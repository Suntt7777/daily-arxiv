The methodology combines dynamic asset eligibility, deterministic rebalancing, and bounded multi-factor tilts applied to an equal-weight baseline. Asset eligibility is formalized as a state-dependent constraint on portfolio construction, allowing factor exposure to adjust endogenously in response to observable market conditions such as liquidity, volatility, and cross-sectional breadth. Rather than estimating expected returns or covariances, the framework relies on cross-sectional rankings and hard structural bounds to control concentration, turnover, and fragility. The resulting approach is fully algorithmic, transparent, and directly implementable. It provides a robustness-oriented alternative to parametric optimization and unconstrained multi-factor models, particularly suited for long-horizon allocations where stability and operational feasibility are primary objectives."}

This is accomplished in conventional CP decomposition by fitting a low-rank tensor to data with respect to the least-squares loss. Generalized CP (GCP) decompositions generalize this approach by allowing general loss functions that can be more appropriate, e.g., to model binary and count data or to improve robustness to outliers. However, GCP decompositions do not explicitly account for any symmetry in the tensors, which commonly arises in modern applications. For example, a tensor formed by stacking the adjacency matrices of a dynamic graph over time will naturally exhibit symmetry along the two modes corresponding to the graph nodes. In this paper, we develop a symmetric GCP (SymGCP) decomposition that allows for general forms of symmetry, i.e., symmetry along any subset of the modes. SymGCP accounts for symmetry by enforcing the corresponding symmetry in the decomposition. We derive gradients for SymGCP that enable its efficient computation via all-at-once optimization with existing tensor kernels. The form of the gradients also leads to various stochastic approximations that enable us to develop stochastic SymGCP algorithms that can scale to large tensors. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed SymGCP algorithms with a variety of experiments on both synthetic and real data."}

This problem can be formulated as the minimization of the trace of the solution of a Lyapunov equation whose coefficient matrix depends on $ν$. For physical relevance, the damping coefficients must be nonnegative and the resulting system must be asymptotically stable. We identify conditions under which the system is never stable or may lose stability for certain choices of $ν$. In the latter case, we propose replacing the constraint $ν\\ge 0$ with $ν\\ge d$, where $d$ is a nonzero nonnegative vector chosen to ensure stability.\n  We derive explicit expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the objective function and show that the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker conditions are equivalent to the vanishing of a nonlinear residual function at an optimal solution. To compute such a solution, we propose a Barzilai--Borwein residual minimization algorithm (BBRMA), which is simple and efficient but not globally convergent, and a spectral projected gradient (SPG) method, which is globally convergent. By exploiting the structure of the problem, we show how to efficiently compute the objective function and its gradient, with eigenvalue decompositions constituting the dominant cost in terms of execution time. Numerical experiments show that both methods require fewer eigenvalue decompositions than the fast optimal damping algorithm (FODA), and that, although SPG may incur additional decompositions due to line search, it often converges faster than BBRMA, leading to a lower overall computational effort."}

Inspired by regularized continuous reformulations of the maximum-clique problem, we derive a penalized continuous formulation leading to a nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problem. We further introduce the notion of stable global solutions, namely points remaining optimal under small perturbations of the penalty parameters, and prove an equivalence between stable global solutions of the continuous reformulation and largest cliques that are common to all the adversarially perturbed graphs.

These \"latent positions\" are often estimated via embeddings, whereby the nodes of a network are mapped to points in Euclidean space so that \"similar\" nodes are mapped to nearby points. Under certain model assumptions, these embeddings are consistent estimates of the latent positions, but most such results require that the embedding dimension be chosen correctly, typically equal to the dimension of the latent space. Methods for estimating this correct embedding dimension have been studied extensive in recent years, but there has been little work to date characterizing the behavior of embeddings when this embedding dimension is misspecified. In this work, we provide theoretical descriptions of the effects of misspecifying the embedding dimension of the adjacency spectral embedding under the random dot product graph, a class of latent space network models that includes a number of widely-used network models as special cases, including the stochastic blockmodel. We consider both the case in which the dimension is chosen too small, where we prove estimation error lower-bounds, and the case where the dimension is chosen too large, where we show that consistency still holds, albeit at a slower rate than when the embedding dimension is chosen correctly.A range of synthetic data experiments support our theoretical results. Our main technical result, which may be of independent interest, is a generalization of earlier work in random matrix theory, showing that all non-signal eigenvectors of a low-rank matrix subject to additive noise are delocalized."}

Due to the high-order derivatives (sixth-order) and the strongly nonlinear term (locally Lipschitz), developing high-order stable schemes and establishing corresponding error estimates is particularly challenging. In this study, we first establish a general framework for high-order implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge--Kutta methods that preserves the original energy dissipation for auxiliary models with globally Lipschitz truncations on the nonlinear term. By employing the Sobolev embedding theorem and Cauchy's interlace theorem, we demonstrate that the solutions of the auxiliary models are identical to the solutions of the original models without the globally Lipschitz property, provided that the free energy of the initial value is well-defined. Furthermore, we rigorously prove the uniform boundedness of the solution in the L-infinity norm and unconditional global-in-time stability. This allows for a straightforward framework to derive optimal arbitrarily high-order L-infinity error estimate without relying on the Lipschitz assumption. In particular, compared to existing literature, the argument for error estimation is presented in a much more simplified and elegant manner, without imposing any constraints on time-step size or mesh grid size. In fact, the reported framework, built upon the truncated auxiliary problem for the original model, can be directly extended to a wide range of gradient flows, including Allen--Cahn equations, nonlocal PFC models, and epitaxial thin film growth equations, providing unconditional energy dissipation without enforcing Lipschitz continuity. Finally, we present numerical examples to validate our analytical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of capturing long-time dynamics."}

High-fidelity approaches require repeated forward and adjoint PDE solves inside nested Bayesian inversion and design loops. We formulate SBOED as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and learn an amortized design policy via policy-gradient reinforcement learning (PGRL), enabling online design selection from the experiment history without repeatedly solving an SBOED optimization problem. To make policy training and reward evaluation scalable, we combine dual dimension reduction -- active subspace projection for the parameter and principal component analysis for the state -- with an adjusted derivative-informed latent attention neural operator (LANO) surrogate that predicts both the parameter-to-solution map and its Jacobian. We use a Laplace-based D-optimality reward while noting that, in general, other expected-information-gain utilities such as KL divergence can also be used within the same framework. We further introduce an eigenvalue-based evaluation strategy that uses prior samples as proxies for maximum a posteriori (MAP) points, avoiding repeated MAP solves while retaining accurate information-gain estimates. Numerical experiments on sequential multi-sensor placement for contaminant source tracking demonstrate approximately $100\\times$ speedup over high-fidelity finite element methods, improved performance over random sensor placements, and physically interpretable policies that discover an ``upstream'' tracking strategy."}

The limiting process captures essential behavioral features of the underlying stochastic dynamics, including goal-directed motion, inter-agent repulsion, and reflection at domain boundaries. This result provides a rigorous analytical framework for approximating constrained queueing networks and crowd motion models, offering tractable characterizations of their steady-state behavior and transient dynamics under large-scale regimes. We further illustrate the theoretical findings through two numerical examples. The first example considers a crowd dynamics scenario, modeling interacting agents navigating within a confined domain, while the second focuses on a neural population model that describes stochastic activity evolution under competition and bounded constraints. These experiments validate the convergence predicted by the diffusion approximation and demonstrate how discrete stochastic systems with reflection and interaction mechanisms approach their continuous reflected OU limits, offering both physical and biosocial interpretations of the theory."}

Numerical methods for these models are challenged by increased stiffness for small scaling parameters and the necessity of asymptotics preservation regarding a parabolic limit equation. As a prototype model, we consider the telegraph equation in one spatial dimension subject to periodic boundary conditions with an asymptotic limit given by the linear heat equation. We provide a general semidiscrete stability result for this model when spatially discretized by arbitrary periodic (upwind) SBP operators and formally prove that the fully discrete scheme is asymptotic preserving. Moreover, we prove that DoD with central numerical fluxes leads to periodic SBP operators. Furthermore, we show that adapting the upwind DoD scheme yields periodic upwind SBP operators. Consequently, the DoD stabilization possesses the desired properties considered in the first part of this work and thus leads to a stable and asymptotic preserving scheme for the telegraph equation. We back our theoretical results with numerical simulations and demonstrate the applicability of this cut-cell stabilization for implicit time integration in the heat equation limit."}

Without any solver modifications, both solvers reproduce, and in several cases improve upon, the best solutions previously reported in the literature, including the recent LLM-driven discoveries. Our results not only highlight the maturity of generic NLP technology and its ability to tackle nonlinear mathematical problems that were out of reach for general-purpose solvers only a decade ago, but also position global NLP solvers as powerful tools that may be exploited within LLM-driven algorithm discovery."}

The stability near the interface is guaranteed by a local polynomial extension technique combined with ghost penalty bilinear forms, from which the robust condition number estimates and the error estimates are derived. Furthermore, the jump penalty term for weakly enforcing the jump condition in our method is also defined based on the local polynomial extension, which enables us to establish the error estimation particularly for solutions with low regularity. We perform a series of numerical tests in two and three dimensions to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method."}

We study these two parameters in two commonly considered models of random preferential attachment graphs, with $h \\geq 2$ edges added per step. We establish new bounds for the likely edge expansion for both random models.
