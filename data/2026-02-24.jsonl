To address this challenge, we introduce Unbalanced Synchronized Optimal Transport (UnSyncOT), a novel dynamical framework that synchronizes transport-reaction flows between spaces via either geometric embeddings (Monge type) or Markov kernels (Kantorovich type). For both cases we prove that UnSyncOT can be reduced to a single-space problem: the Monge model becomes a Benamou-Brenier problem with a metric-modified kinetic energy, and the Kantorovich model yields a nonlocal action induced by the synchronization operator, both of which fit within a dissipation-distance formulation. We also analyze the pure transport (Wasserstein) and pure reaction (Fisher-Rao) limits and derive structural properties. For the Kantorovich case we propose an approximate UnSyncOT by introducing a Hellinger-Kantorovich based trapezoidal time discretization of the secondary action for efficient computation. Finally we present staggered-grid discretizations and primal-dual solvers, validate the convergence, stability, and efficiency, and demonstrate coherent dynamics reconstructions across spaces."}

The objective is to maximize the expected total reward relative to that of a prophet who observes all rewards in advance. This problem captures the performance limits achievable in online resource allocation and underlies posted-price mechanisms in online marketplaces. We characterize the optimal welfare achievable relative to the prophet in terms of $k$ and the extreme value index of the reward distribution, in the asymptotic regime where the number of offers $n$ grows large. This optimal performance ratio turns out to be at least $1-\\frac{\\log k}{8k}[1+ε]$ for any $ε> 0$ and sufficiently large $k$, improving upon the respective, tight $1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2πk}}$ guarantee of static-threshold algorithms. We additionally analyze the certainty-equivalent (CE) heuristic, a widely used online allocation algorithm known to yield optimal regret growth in $n$ when evaluated under the fluid scaling assumption. Even in the absence of the fluid scaling, the CE heuristics's performance improves with $k$ to eventually match the leading order terms of the optimal dynamic program's performance ratio. A finer analysis nevertheless reveals that regret can be divergent and large relative to the optimal dynamic program when $n/k \\to \\infty$. This highlights the sensitivity in viewing the CE heuristic's performance under the commonly adopted, though subjective, fluid scaling assumption."}

To promote a vector of coefficients with mostly vanishing entries, we consider a stochastic extension of the dictionary coding problem model with a random hierarchical sparsity promoting prior.

To address these difficulties, we employ a boundary integral formulation thereby avoiding volumetric discretization. In this framework, the accuracy of the numerical solution depends strongly on how the material interfaces are discretized. In this work, we demonstrate that standard meshing strategies based on resolving the maximum wavenumber across the domain become computationally inefficient in multilayered configurations, where high wavenumbers are confined to localized subdomains. Through a systematic study of multilayer transmission problems, we show that no simple discretization rule based on the maximum wavenumber or material contrasts emerges. Instead, the wavenumber of the background (exterior) medium plays a dominant role in determining the optimal boundary resolution. Building on these insights, we propose an adaptive approach that achieves uniform accuracy and efficient computation across multiple layers. Numerical experiments for a range of multilayer configurations demonstrate the scalability and robustness of the proposed approach."}

This paper proposes several new reformulations for 0-1 quadratic programming problems using the QNR technique. Such a technique provides more flexibility in adding nonconvex quadratic constraints into the problem formulation, so that some valid inequalities, such as the triangle inequalities, can be incorporated into the formulation to tighten the lower bound of the problem. We analyze the effects of the proposed reformulations on the lower bounds implemented in the solver, and propose some methods to maximize the McCormick relaxation bounds of the reformulations.

Armed with integration by parts in the reverse form we provide an elementary derivation of an exact error represenation of Hermite quadrature rule. This approach possesses several advantages over the classical approaches: i) Only integration by parts is needed for the derivation; ii) the error representation requires much milder regularity, namely the existence of nth-order derivative rather than a (2n)th-order derivative of the function under consideration. As a result, our error formula is valid for less regular functions for which the classical ones are not valid; iii) our approach rediscovers Legendre polynomials and more interestingly it provides a surprisingly elegant relation between Legendre polynomial and Hermite interpolation. In particular, Legendre polynomials are precisely the error kernels for interpolatory Hermite quadrature rules; and iv) We also rediscover the Rodrigues formula for Legendre polynomials as part of our findings.

The problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) in which the objective is to minimize long-run average costs. We prove the equivalence of an alternative formulation based on rewards and use this to develop an index heuristic policy, which is shown to be optimal in certain special cases. We then use rollout-based reinforcement learning techniques to develop a novel online policy improvement (OPI) approach, which uses the index heuristic as a base policy and also as an insurance option at decision epochs where the best action cannot be selected with sufficient confidence. Results from extensive numerical experiments, involving randomly-generated network layouts and parameter values, show that the OPI heuristic is able to achieve close-to-optimal performance in fast-changing systems with state transitions occurring 100 times per second, suggesting that it is suitable for online implementation."}

This article demonstrates that something similar happens to the known estimators $\\hatΔ$, $\\hatα_i$, and $\\hat{\\mathcal{S}}_i$ of $Δ$, $α_i$ and $\\mathcal{S}_i$ (respectively), proposes new and less biased estimators $\\hatΔ_U$, $\\hatα_{iU}$, and $\\hat{\\mathcal{S}}_{iU}$, determines their variances, analyses the behaviour of all estimators, and concludes that the new estimators should be used when $n$ or $K$ are small (at least when $n\\leq 50$ or $K\\leq 3$). Additionally, the case where one of the raters is a gold standard is contemplated, in which situation two new parameters arise: the $conformity$ (the rater's capability to recognize a subject in the category $i$) and the $predictivity$ (the reliability of a response $i$ by the rater)."}

Existing studies primarily rely on stringent growth conditions or local convexity-like properties, making the development of alternative algorithms desirable. In this work, we study a class of stochastic $N$-player noncooperative games characterized by a potential function. We first consider the nonconvex smooth setting and develop a randomized stochastic gradient (RSG) scheme. The RSG scheme achieves the optimal sample complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N^{2}ε^{-4})$ for reaching a point whose expected residual has norm at most $ε$. Building on this result, we introduce a randomized smoothed RSG (RS-RSG) scheme for solving stochastic potential games afflicted by nonconvexity and nonsmoothness. We show that RS-RSG asymptotically converges to an equilibrium of the smoothed game with sample complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L^{4}_{\\max}n^{3/2}_{\\max}N^{3}η^{-1}ε^{-4})$, where $η>0$ is the smoothing parameter. Under Lipschitz continuity of the Clarke subdifferentials, we show that the expected residual evaluated at the smoothed equilibrium is $\\mathcal{O}(η^{2})$. In addition, we discuss the biased RSG and RS-RSG variants and demonstrate the effectiveness of the biased RS-RSG scheme on a class of stochastic potential hierarchical games where the exact lower-level solution is unavailable in finite time.

To do this, we focus on linear dynamical systems that are compatible with a given network, and consider policies that switch periodically between the given one and an alternative, topologically-compatible dynamics. In particular, we seek to solve design problems aimed at finding a) the optimal switching schedule between two preselected topologies, and b) an optimal topology and optimal switching schedule. By imposing periodicity, we first provide a metric of resilience in terms of the spectral abscissa of the averaged linear time-invariant dynamics. By restricting our policies to commutative networks, we then show how the optimal scheduling problem reduces to a convex optimization, providing a bound on the net resilience that can be achieved. After this, we find that the optimal, sparse commutative network to switch with is fully disconnected and allocates the spectral sum among the nodes of the network equally. We then impose additional restrictions on topology edge selection, which leads to a biconvex optimization for which certain matrix rank conditions guide the choice of weighting parameters to obtain desirable solutions.

Focusing on $X_{=t}$ (individuals in exactly $t$ subsets) and employing the MAO norm -- a combinatorial tool yielding closed-form factorial moments -- we derive the exact marginal distribution of a single individual as $\\mathrm{Bin}(T,p)$ with $p=m/N$. Using the MAO norm, we prove that for any fixed number of distinct individuals, their joint distribution differs from the product of marginals by $O(1/N)$, establishing the weak dependence required for limit theorems. Based on these findings, we delineate two asymptotic regimes: 1. Normal approximation: When $N\\to\\infty$ with $p=m/N$ fixed, $X_{=t}$ obeys a central limit theorem and can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean $Nπ_t$ and variance obtained from the MAO norm, where $π_t = \\binom{T}{t} p^t (1-p)^{T-t}$.2. Poisson approximation: When the expected value $λ_N := Nπ_t \\to 0$, $X_{=t}$ converges in distribution to $\\mathrm{Poisson}(λ)$. By symmetry, if $λ_N \\to N$, then $N-X_{=t}$ converges to a Poisson distribution. All theoretical results are rigorously proved via moment methods and are corroborated by extensive numerical simulations, which further demonstrate that the approximations remain valid even when the subset sizes are not equal. The MAO norm thus emerges as a unifying tool that connects the exact combinatorial structure of the model to its asymptotic theory. These findings offer clear guidance for choosing the appropriate approximation in practical applications, and they open the door to using the MAO distribution as a null model for detecting non random aggregation in fields as diverse as ecology, sociology, and statistical physics."}

To address this issue, we propose an efficient approximation algorithm that aims to achieve a prescribed forward error, together with a high-accuracy numerical algorithm based on the Ozaki scheme -- an emulation technique for matrix multiplication -- adapted to this problem. Since the proposed method is not primarily focused on reducing backward errors, the computational cost can be significantly reduced.

We also provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, proving the unconditional energy stability of the iterative scheme. Furthermore, we prove that for a wide class of data fidelity terms, the convex relaxation inherently enforces a binary solution, justifying the effectiveness of the method without explicit penalization.

To explain and predict the fine-grained dynamical behavior inside these regions, we develop a local second-order limit dynamics framework for ADMM near an arbitrary KKT point -- not necessarily the eventual limit point of the iterates. Assuming the existence of a strictly complementary primal--dual solution pair, we derive a second-order local expansion of the ADMM dynamics by leveraging a refined and simplified variational characterization of the (parabolic) second-order directional derivative of the PSD projection operator. This expansion reveals a closed convex cone of directions along which the local first-order update vanishes, and it induces a second-order limit map that governs the persistent drift after transient effects are filtered out. We characterize fundamental properties of this mapping, including its kernel, range, and continuity. A primal--dual decoupling further yields a clean scaling law for the effect of the penalty parameter in ADMM. We connect these properties to second-order dynamical features of ADMM, including fixed points, almost-invariant sets, and microscopic phases. Three empirical phenomena in slow-convergence regions are then explained or predicted: (i) angles between consecutive iterate differences are small yet nonzero, except for sparse spikes; (ii) primal and dual infeasibilities are insensitive to penalty-parameter updates; and (iii) iterates can be transiently trapped in a low-dimensional subspace for an extended period.

By introducing some new notations, we reformulate the original model into a fluid-fluid coupling problem, which is viewed as a generalized nonlinear Stokes sub-problem combined with a reaction-diffusion sub-problem. Then, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution for the reformulated problem, and propose a stable, fully discrete multiphysics finite element method which employs Lagrangian finite element pairs for spatial discretization and a backward Euler scheme for temporal discretization. By ensuring the parameters $κ_1$ and $κ_3$ remain bounded and non-zero even as $λ$ tends to infinity, the proposed method maintains stability for a wide range of Lagrangian element pairs. Based on the continuity and monotonicity of the nonlinear term $\\mathcal{N}(\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{u}_h^{n}))$, we give the stability analysis and derive optimal error estimates for the displacement vector $\\mathbf{u}$ and the pressure $p$ in both $L^2$-norm and $H^1$-norm. In particular, the $L^2$-norm error estimate for the displacement $\\mathbf{u}$, which was not present in previous literature, is established here through an auxiliary problem and a Poincar$\\acute{e}$ inequality. Also, we present numerical tests to verify the theoretical analysis, and the results confirm the optimal convergence rates. Finally, we draw conclusions to summarize the work."}

In contrast to the high-temperature regime studied by Cuff et al. (J. Stat. Phys. 149: 432-477, 2012), in which the Gibbs measure is concentrated around the equiproportional distribution of spins, the Gibbs measure in the low-temperature regime is concentrated on multiple states, each with a dominant number of a single spin. Consequently, global mixing of the system requires sufficiently many transitions between these states. Since these transitions are well explained by the phenomenon of metastability, the theory of metastability plays a central role in the analysis of slow mixing. In particular, the sharp asymptotics for the mixing time is given by the mixing time of the limit Markov chain, which describes the metastable behavior of the dynamics, multiplied by the metastable transition time-scale. As a byproduct, we verify that it does not exhibit a cutoff phenomenon."}

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Stiefel retraction with both these properties. A variety of retractions is known on the Stiefel manifold, including the Riemannian exponential map, the polar factor retraction, the QR-retraction and the Cayley retraction, but none of them features a closed-form inverse. The only Stiefel retraction with closed-form inverse that we are aware of is based on quasi-geodesics, but this one is of first order."}

In this work, we provide a detailed and rigorous analysis of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrices associated with the Van Leer splitting for the one-dimensional Euler equations. By constructing the Sturm sequence of the discriminant, we prove that for the admissible parameter range $1 \\le γ\\le 3$, $|M|<1$, and $a>0$, the Jacobian $\\partial F^+/\\partial U$ has one zero eigenvalue and two positive real eigenvalues, confirming Van Leer's original claim.

For the linear pressure splitting we show that the eigenvalues are not all of the same sign, while for the second-order pressure splitting we prove that all coefficients of the characteristic equation are positive.

Its finite-dimensional distributions are determinants of block matrices built from transition probabilities and their cumulative sums; a finite block matrix suffices even when the initial configuration is infinite. As applications, we recover the Rayleigh spacing density and the joint distribution of consecutive gaps-which are negatively correlated-by new methods, and give a new derivation of the determinantal formula for the joint CDF of finitely many coalescing particles starting from fixed positions. All formulas hold for arbitrary nearest-neighbor random walks and their Brownian scaling limits, with no specific transition kernels required."}

Such a problem may be naturally called tropical or \"max-plus\" optimal transportation problem. We show that the solutions to the latter, called the optimal tropical plans, may not correspond to perfect matchings even if the data (max-plus probability measures) have all weights equal to zero, in contrast with the classical discrete optimal transportation analogue, where perfect matching optimal plans in similar situations always exist. Nevertheless, in some randomized situation the existence of perfect matching optimal tropical plans may occur rather frequently. At last, we prove that the uniqueness of solutions of the optimal tropical transportation problem is quite rare."}
