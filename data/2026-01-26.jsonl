Reproducible benchmarks are defined with a focus on having exact sharp interface solutions, allowing for identification of dominant error terms. Speedups of 4 to 114 over the classic forward Euler integrator are achievable while still using a fully explicit scheme without appreciable accuracy loss.

However, explicit constructions achieving this optimal linear dependence remain elusive. Recently, Dick and Pillichshammer (2025) made significant progress by showing that a multiset union of randomly digitally shifted Korobov polynomial lattice point sets almost achieve the optimal dimension dependence with high probability.\n  In this paper, we investigate the analog of this result in the setting of classical integer arithmetic using Fourier analysis. We analyze point sets constructed as multiset unions of Korobov rank-1 lattice point sets modulo a prime $N$. We provide a comprehensive analysis covering four distinct construction scenarios, combining either random or fixed integer generators with either continuous torus shifts or discrete grid shifts. We prove that in all four cases, the star discrepancy is bounded by a term of order $O(s \\log(N_{tot}) / \\sqrt{N_{tot}})$ with high probability, where $N_{tot}$ is the total number of points. This implies that the inverse of the star discrepancy for these structured sets depends quadratically on the dimension $s$. While the proofs are probabilistic, our results significantly reduce the search space for optimal point sets from a continuum to a finite set of candidates parameterized by integer generators and random shifts."}

To address these challenges, we developed a novel spatiotemporal coupling high-resolution ghost fluid method featuring two key advancements: 1) Integration of nonlinear geometrical optics to properly account for thermodynamic entropy evolution. 2) Implementation of the Lax-Wendroff/Cauchy-Kowalevski approach to incorporate tangential fluxes and source term effects. These enhancements have been systematically applied to Riemann problem-based ghost fluid methods.

We are interested in the macroscopic behavior of the distribution of particles, captured by linear statistics, partition functions, and their finite-size corrections as N is large. We prove the law of large numbers and large deviations for the empirical measure around the equilibrium measure. To reach finite-size correction we assume off-criticality. For fixed filling fractions, we prove an asymptotic expansion for the partition function and for the cumulants of linear statistics, in particular establishing a central limit theorem. For varying filling fractions, we prove that the central limit theorem is perturbed by an additional discrete Gaussian component oscillating with N. We apply our general results to the study of uniformly random lozenge tilings on a large class of domains -- not necessarily planar, simply-connected, nor orientable. When the analogues of filling fractions are fixed and this domain is orientable, we show that the Gaussian fluctuations on the vertical extend to the whole liquid region and are governed there by the Gaussian free field, as predicted by the Kenyon-Okounkov conjecture.

Yet, the available methods are either restricted to low-dimensional systems or suffer from conservative approximations. To address these limitations, we propose control architectures that combine the flexibility of Markov Decision Processes with the scalability of Model Predictive Controllers. The Model Predictive Controller tracks reference signals while remaining agnostic to the stochasticity and reach-avoid objective. Instead, the reach-avoid probability is maximized by optimally updating the controller's reference online. To achieve this, the closed-loop system, consisting of the system and Model Predictive Controller, is abstracted as a Markov Decision Process in which a new reference can be chosen at every time-step. A feedback policy generating optimal references is then computed via Dynamic Programming. If the state space of the system is continuous, the Dynamic Programming algorithm must be executed on a finite system approximation. Modifications to the Model Predictive Controller enable a computationally efficient robustification of the Dynamic Programming algorithm to approximation errors, preserving bounds on the achieved reach-avoid probability. The approach is validated on a perturbed 12D quadcopter model in cluttered reach-avoid environments proving its flexibility and scalability."}

To address this, this work proposes an Operator Splitting Method (OSM) based on Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to decouple the geometric interface evolution from the physical field reconstruction. Within a predictor-corrector framework, the method splits the coupled system into an alternating sequence of two linear and convex subproblems: solving the diffusion equation on fixed subdomains and updating the interface geometry based on the Stefan condition. A key contribution is the formulation of both steps as linear least-squares problems; this transforms the computational strategy from a non-convex gradient-based optimization into a stable fixed-point iteration composed of alternating convex solvers. From a theoretical perspective, the relaxed iterative operator is shown to be locally contractive, and its fixed points are consistent with stationary points of the coupled residual functional. Benchmarks across 1D to 3D domains demonstrate the stability and high accuracy of the method, confirming that the proposed framework provides a highly accurate and efficient numerical solution for free boundary problems."}

Various distributional properties of these processes and related governing differential equations are obtained. Later, we define and analyze a spatial Skellam-type point process via GPRF. Moreover, a fractional variant of it in the two parameter case is studied in detail."}

Focusing on this setting, we carry out a general convergence and complexity analysis for algorithmic frameworks. Consequently, we discuss theoretically sound strategies to integrate momentum information within classical projected gradient type algorithms. One of these approaches is then developed in detail, up to the definition of a tailored algorithm with both theoretical guarantees and reasonable per-iteration cost. The proposed method is finally shown to outperform the standard (spectral) projected gradient method in two different experimental benchmarks, indicating that the addition of momentum terms is as beneficial in the constrained setting as it is in the unconstrained scenario."}

In Shu et al. (2007) it was shown that SDC for ODEs achieves one order per iteration. We show that this carries over to the new SDC scheme. The method is derived from the approach of spectral deferred corrections and the idea of enforcing the algebraic constraints without numerical integration as in the approach of $\\varepsilon$-embedding in Hairer and Wanner (1996). It enforces the algebraic constraints to be satisfied in each iteration and allows an efficient solve of semi-explicit DAEs with high-accuracy. The proposed scheme is compared with other DAE methods. We demonstrate that the proposed SDC scheme is competitive with Runge-Kutta methods for DAEs in terms of accuracy and its parallelized versions are very efficient in comparison to other SDC methods."}

Standard Euler schemes are then not convergent, and theoretical guarantees in this situation are scarce. In this work we introduce a Lyapunov-tamed Euler scheme, for drift coefficients for which the weak derivative is dominated by a function that obeys a certain generic Lyapunov-type condition. This allows for a range of coefficients that explode to infinity on a bounded set. We establish that, in terms of Lp-strong error, the Lyapunov-tamed scheme is consistent and moreover achieves the same order of convergence as the standard Euler scheme for Lipschitz coefficients. The general result is applied to systems of mean-field particles with singular repulsive interaction in 1D, yielding an error bound with polynomial dependency in the number of particles."}

A computational bottleneck in Bayesian inference for CGGMs is the evaluation of Diaconis-Ylvisaker normalizing constants, given by gamma-type integrals over cones of precision matrices with prescribed zeros and equality constraints. While explicit formulas are known for standard Gaussian graphical models only in special cases (e.g. decomposable graphs) and for a limited class of RCOP models, no general tractable framework has been available for broader families of CGGMs.\n  We introduce a new subclass of RCON models for which these normalizing constants admit closed-form expressions. On the algebraic side, we identify conditions on spaces of colored precision matrices that guarantee tractability of the associated integrals, leading to Block-Cholesky spaces (BC-spaces) and Diagonally Commutative Block-Cholesky spaces (DCBC-spaces). On the combinatorial side, we characterize the colored graphs inducing such spaces via a color perfect elimination ordering and a 2-path regularity condition, and define the resulting Color Elimination-Regular (CER) graphs and their symmetric variants. This class strictly extends decomposable graphs in the uncolored setting and contains all RCOP models associated with decomposable graphs. In the one-color case, our framework reveals a close connection between DCBC-spaces and Bose-Mesner algebras.\n  For models defined on BC- and DCBC-spaces, we derive explicit closed-form formulas for the normalizing constants in terms of a finite collection of structure constants and propose an efficient method for computing them in the commutative case. Our results broaden the range of CGGMs amenable to principled Bayesian structure learning in high-dimensional applications."}

The system dynamics are governed by a linear control model subject to path constraints. The aim is to maximize the power production profit while respecting operational restrictions on reservoir water levels. The challenge is the presence of uncontrollable spillways: their discontinuous nature and the fact that they are activated at the state boundary prevent the application of known necessary conditions of optimality. To overcome this, we derive necessary conditions by approximating the original problem through a sequence of standard optimal control problems using exponential penalty functions. The applicability of resulting conditions are illustrated by an example."}

This DD solver, called Generalized Optimized Schwarz Method (GOSM), is a substructuring method, that is, the unknowns of an iteration are associated with the subdomains interfaces. We extend the analysis presented in a previous paper of one of the author to a fully discrete setting. We do not consider only a specific set of boundary conditions, but a whole class including, e.g., Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin conditions. Our analysis will also cover interface conditions corresponding to a Finite Element Method - Boundary Element Method (FEM-BEM) coupling. In particular, we shall focus on three classical FEM-BEM couplings, namely the Costabel, Johnson-Nédélec and Bielak-MacCamy couplings. As a remarkable outcome, the present contribution yields well-posed substructured formulations of these classical FEM-BEM couplings for wavenumbers different from classical spurious resonances. We also establish an explicit relation between the dimensions of the kernels of the initial variational formulation, the local problems and the substructured formulation. That relation especially holds for any wavenumber for the substructured formulation of Costabel FEM-BEM coupling, which allows us to prove that the latter formulation is well-posed even at spurious resonances. Besides, we introduce a systematically geometrically convergent iterative method for the Costabel FEM-BEM coupling, with estimates on the convergence speed."}

The underlying framework of dissipation-based weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) stabilization for high-order CG and DG approximations was introduced in our previous work. In this general framework, Hermite WENO (HWENO) reconstructions are used to calculate local smoothness sensors that determine the appropriate amount of artificial viscosity for each cell. In the original version, candidate polynomials for WENO averaging are constructed using the derivative data from von Neumann neighbors. We upgrade this standard `cell-cell' reconstruction procedure by using WENO polynomials associated with mesh vertices as candidate polynomials for cell-based WENO averaging. The Hermite data of individual cells is sent to vertices of those cells, after which vertex-averaged HWENO data is sent back to cells containing the vertices. The new `cell-vertex' averaging procedure includes the data of vertex neighbors without explicitly adding them to the reconstruction stencils. It mitigates mesh imprinting and can also be used in classical HWENO limiters for DG methods. The second main novelty of the proposed approach is a quadrature-driven distribution of artificial viscosity within high-order finite elements. Replacing the linear quadrature weights by their nonlinear WENO-type counterparts, we concentrate shock-capturing dissipation near discontinuities while minimizing it in smooth portions of troubled cells. This redistribution of WENO stabilization preserves the total dissipation rate within each cell and improves local shock resolution without relying on subcell decomposition techniques. Numerical experiments in one and two dimensions demonstrate substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness for high-order elements."}
