Such problems can be solved by constructing continuous-time gradient flows that converge to the minimizer of the energy function under consideration, and then implementing discrete-time algorithms that approximate the flow. In this work, we focus on the Fisher-Rao gradient flow and we construct an interacting particle system that approximates the flow as its mean-field limit. We discuss the connection between the energy function, the gradient flow and the particle system and explain different approaches to smoothing out the energy function with an appropriate kernel in a way that allows for the particle system to be well-defined. We provide a rigorous proof of the existence and uniqueness of thus obtained kernelized flows, as well as a propagation of chaos result that provides a theoretical justification for using the corresponding kernelized particle systems as approximation algorithms in entropic mean-field optimization."}

However, this process is inefficient and may lead to a suboptimal design. We propose formulating the optimal control and multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) problems as a single problem with linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control. We use the coupled adjoint method to compute the design variable derivatives, which are critical for gradient-based design optimization. The computational cost of the derivative computation using the adjoint method is independent of the number of design variables, making it suitable for large-scale problems. We show that the coupled adjoint can be solved indirectly and more efficiently by solving three smaller adjoint equations that leverage the feedforward structure of the problem. We demonstrate this new approach on two test problems: design optimization of a classic cart-pole problem and the aerodynamic shape of a quadrotor blade. For the quadrotor blade design problem, we reduce the control cost by 10% by optimizing the blade for a specific control task with a slight penalty in steady hovering power consumption."}

The main sources of uncertainty are stochastic surgical durations and patients' lengths of stay. We developed a two-stage stochastic programming model where in the first stage we decide on 1) the number of non-shared ICU and ward beds to be allocated to each specialty, and 2) the allocation of surgeries to operating rooms during the planning horizon. In the second stage, we decide on 1) the number of shared beds in ICU and wards to be allocated to different specialties on each day during the planning horizon, 2) the surge capacity required to satisfy downstream service to patients, and 3) the overtime incurred in operating rooms. The proposed model aims at minimizing the total cost including the patients' waiting cost, postponement cost, overtime and fixed cost of operating rooms, and the cost of downstream surge capacity. We have implemented the proposed stochastic programming model in a sample average approximation framework. To enhance the efficiency of sample average approximation, we have developed a specialized algorithm that quickly solves the second-stage model for any given first-stage solution for a large number of scenarios. We have carried out extensive computational experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of several pooling policies for downstream beds and also the efficiency of the proposed sample average approximation algorithm. Moreover, we have performed an extensive sensitivity analysis of cost and stochastic parameters. Our results demonstrated that a full-sharing policy among different specialties in the downstream units enhance the functionality of the system by up to 19.53%.

However, their classical formulation relies on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), whose fixed activation functions and global approximation biases limit performance in problems with oscillatory behavior, multiscale dynamics, or sharp gradients. In parallel, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been introduced as a functionally adaptive architecture based on learnable univariate transformations along each edge, providing richer local approximations and improved expressivity. This work presents a systematic and controlled comparison between standard MLP-based PINNs and their KAN-based counterparts, Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs), using identical physics-informed formulations and matched parameter budgets to isolate the architectural effect. Both models are evaluated across a representative collection of ODEs and PDEs, including cases with known analytical solutions that allow direct assessment of gradient reconstruction accuracy. The results show that PIKANs consistently achieve more accurate solutions, converge in fewer iterations, and yield superior gradient estimates, highlighting their advantage for physics-informed learning. These findings underline the potential of KAN-based architectures as a next-generation approach for scientific machine learning and provide rigorous evidence to guide model selection in differential equation solving."}

The method advocates to interpolate the Cosserat rotation tensor using geodesic elements, which maintain objectivity and correctly represent curvature measures. At the same time, it proposes relaxing the interaction between the rotation tensor and the deformation tensor to alleviate locking effects. This relaxation is achieved in two steps. First, the regularity of the Cosserat rotation tensor is reduced by interpolating it into the Nédélec space. Second, the resulting field is projected back onto the Lie-group of rotations. Together, these steps define a lower-regularity projection-based interpolation. This construction allows the discrete Cosserat rotation tensor to match the polar part of the discrete deformation tensor while remaining objective. This ensures stable behaviour in the asymptotic regime as the Cosserat couple modulus tends to infinity, which constrains the model towards its couple-stress limit. We establish the consistency, stability, and optimality of the proposed method through several benchmark problems. The study culminates in a demonstration of its efficacy on a more intricate curved domain, contrasted with outcomes obtained from conventional interpolation techniques."}

Focusing on linear programs, we introduce a decision-focused notion of data informativeness that formalizes when a data set is sufficient to recover the optimal decision. Our notion abstracts away the notion of estimators (how data is used): it depends solely on the structure of the optimization task and the uncertainty. Our main result provides a geometric characterization of data sufficiency: a data set is sufficient if and only if, together with prior knowledge, it captures all cost directions that can change the optimal solution, given the task structure and the uncertainty set. Building on our characterization, we develop a tractable algorithm to determine minimal sufficient data sets under general data collection constraints. Taken together, our work introduces a principled framework for task-aware data collection. We demonstrate the approach in two applications: selecting where to conduct field experiments to inform infrastructure design and choosing which candidates to interview in order to make an optimal hiring decision. Our results illustrate that small, carefully selected data sets often suffice to determine the optimal decisions."}

Classical time integrators do not guarantee positivity and can produce negative or nonphysical numerical solutions. This paper presents a modular correction strategy that can be applied to implicit Runge-Kutta schemes, in particular SDIRK methods. The strategy combines stage-wise clipping with a ratio-based scaling that enforces invariants and is guaranteed to yield nonnegative, conservative solutions. We provide a theoretical analysis of the corrected schemes and characterize their worst-case order of accuracy relative to the underlying base method. Numerical experiments on stiff ODE systems (Robertson, MAPK, stratospheric chemistry) and a nonlinear PDE (the Korteweg-De Vries equation) demonstrate that the corrected SDIRK methods preserve positivity and invariants without significant loss of accuracy. Importantly, corrections applied only to the final stage are sufficient in practice, while applying them at all stages may distort dynamics in some cases. For explicit Runge-Kutta schemes, the correction maintained positivity but reduced convergence to first order. These results show that the proposed framework provides a simple and effective way to construct positivity-preserving integrators for stiff PD systems."}

It is demonstrated that resorting to reduced bases can speed up a reconstruction algorithm based on combining the lagged diffusivity algorithm with sequential linearizations and preconditioned LSQR iteration without any significant loss of reconstruction quality or of the edge-enhancing nature of total variation regularization. The ideas are numerically tested in three dimensions on unstructured finite element meshes with both simulated and experimental data, resulting in online reconstruction times of only a few seconds on a standard laptop computer."}

It is assumed that one of such constraints is more restrictive than the others. As it can be seen as a resource window constraint, it defines the so-called window-constrained problem. From a bi-objective perspective, a 2-phase algorithm, called BORWin, is devised. It stands for Bi-Objective Relaxation for Window-constrained problems. The first phase is generic for any window-constrained problem and provides a family of upper bounds based on a bi-objective relaxation of the additional constraints. It is shown that the latter bounds strongly relate to the Lagrangian dual bounds. The second phase is derived for a variant involving a graph structure, namely the window-constrained longest-path problem on an acyclic graph. The aim is to take advantage of the upper bounds to devise an efficient label extension algorithm. It is shown that complementary upper bounds could be derived to further improve performance in some special cases. A typical example is when the additional constraints have special knapsack structures. This is the case for the Hydro-Unit Commitment problem with a single plant (1-HUC). From numerical experiments for the 1-HUC, BOR-Win appears to be very efficient compared to state-of-the-art approaches."}

Classical stopping rules are strict and non-randomized, limiting natural exploration in RL settings. To address this, we introduce entropy regularization, allowing randomized stopping policies that balance exploitation and exploration. We derive an explicit analytical solution to the regularized problem and prove convergence of the associated free boundary to the classical stopping threshold as the entropy vanishes. The regularized problem admits a natural formulation as a singular stochastic control problem. Building on this structure, we propose both model-based and model-free policy iteration algorithms to learn the optimal boundary. The model-free method operates without knowledge of system dynamics, using only trajectories from the stochastic environment. We establish convergence guarantees and illustrate strong numerical performance. This framework provides a principled and tractable approach for data-driven stopping problems under uncertainty."}

Such problems can be solved by constructing continuous-time gradient flows that converge to the minimizer of the energy function under consideration, and then implementing discrete-time algorithms that approximate the flow. In this work, we focus on the Fisher-Rao gradient flow and we construct an interacting particle system that approximates the flow as its mean-field limit. We discuss the connection between the energy function, the gradient flow and the particle system and explain different approaches to smoothing out the energy function with an appropriate kernel in a way that allows for the particle system to be well-defined. We provide a rigorous proof of the existence and uniqueness of thus obtained kernelized flows, as well as a propagation of chaos result that provides a theoretical justification for using the corresponding kernelized particle systems as approximation algorithms in entropic mean-field optimization."}

Motivated by recent Laplace-domain MOR methodologies, we construct reduced bases that approximate the time-domain solution with exponential accuracy. We prove convergence bounds that are explicit and robust with respect to the parameters controlling the Ricker wavelet's shape and width and identify an intrinsic accuracy limit dictated by the wavelet's value at the initial time. In particular, the resulting error bound is independent of the underlying Galerkin discretization space and yields computable criteria for the regime in which exponential convergence is observed."}

The outer loop is an instance of the Bregman proximal point algorithm with relative errors in the sense of Solodov and Svaiter, applied to the KKT operator associated with the problem. Akin to classical Lagrange-Newton methods, including primal-dual interior point methods the Bregman proximal point algorithm repeatedly solves regularized KKT inclusions by minimizing a smooth Bregman augmented Lagrangian function, obtained after marginalizing out the multiplier variables. Thanks to non-Euclidean geometries the marginal function is generalized self-concordant and therefore within the regime of Newton's method which converges quadratically if the step-size in the outer proximal point loop is chosen carefully. The operator-theoretic viewpoint allows us to employ the framework of metric subregularity to derive fast rates for the outer loop, and eventually state a joint complexity bound. Important special cases of our framework are a proximal variant of the exponential multiplier method due to Tseng and Bertsekas and interior-point proximal augmented Lagrangian schemes closely related to those of Pougkakiotis and Gondzio."}

A prime example is the unit commitment (UC) problem in electricity markets, where costly subsidies are commonly required. We propose a new pricing scheme for nonconvex markets with both discreteness and nonlinearity, by convexifying nonconvex structures through a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation and deriving prices from the relaxation's dual variables. When the choice set is bounded, we establish strong duality for the SDP, which allows us to extend the envelope theorem to the value function of the relaxation. This extension yields a marginal price signal for demand, which we use as our pricing mechanism. We demonstrate that under certain conditions-for instance, when the relaxation's right hand sides are linear in demand-the resulting lost opportunity cost is bounded by the relaxation's optimality gap. This result highlights the importance of achieving tight relaxations. The proposed framework applies to nonconvex electricity market problems, including for both direct current and alternating current UC. Our numerical experiments indicate that the SDP relaxations are often tight, reinforcing the effectiveness of the proposed pricing scheme. Across a suite of IEEE benchmark instances, the lost opportunity cost under our pricing scheme is, on average, 46% lower than that of the commonly used fixed-binary pricing scheme."}
