However, replacing the underlying random distribution (e.g., demand distribution) with its mean (e.g., the time-varying average arrival rate) introduces bias in performance estimation and can lead to suboptimal decisions. In this paper, we investigate how to identify an alternative point statistic, which is not necessarily the mean, such that substituting this statistic into the two-stage optimization problem yields the optimal decision. We refer to this statistic as the decision-corrected point estimate (time-varying arrival rate). For a general service network with customer abandonment costs, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a corrected point estimate and propose an algorithm for its computation. Under a decomposable network structure, we further show that the resulting decision-corrected point estimate is closely related to the classical newsvendor solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decision-focused correction method compared to the traditional fluid approximation."}

By gradually changing the actual power grid system, smart grid may evolve into different systems by means of size, elements and strategies, but its fundamental requirements and objectives will not change such as optimizing production, transmission, and consumption. Studying the smart grid through modeling and simulation provides us with valuable results which cannot be obtained in real world due to time and cost related constraints. Moreover, due to the complexity of the smart grid, achieving global optimization is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose a complex system based approach to the smart grid modeling, accentuating on the optimization by combining game theoretical and classical methods in different levels. Thanks to this combination, the optimization can be achieved with flexibility and scalability, while keeping its generality."}

The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes."}

Many randomized matrix algorithms proceed by first collecting information about a matrix and then processing that data to perform some computational task. This thesis addresses the following question: How can one design algorithms that use this information as efficiently as possible, reliably achieving the greatest possible speed and accuracy for a limited data budget?\n  The first part of this thesis focuses on low-rank approximation for positive-semidefinite matrices. Here, the goal is to compute an accurate approximation to a matrix after accessing as few entries of the matrix as possible. This part of the thesis explores the randomly pivoted Cholesky (RPCholesky) algorithm for this task, which achieves a level of speed and reliability greater than other methods for the same problem.\n  The second part of this thesis considers the task of estimating attributes of an implicit matrix accessible only by matrix-vector products. This thesis describes the leave-one-out approach to developing matrix attribute estimation algorithms and develops optimized trace, diagonal, and row-norm estimation algorithms.\n  The third part of this thesis considers randomized algorithms for overdetermined linear least squares problems. Randomized algorithms for linear-least squares problems are asymptotically faster than any known deterministic algorithm, but recent work has raised questions about the accuracy of these methods in floating point arithmetic. This thesis shows these issues are resolvable by developing fast randomized least-squares problem achieving backward stability, the gold-standard stability guarantee for a numerical algorithm."}

To solve the problem, we propose an algorithm based on the primal-dual approach combined with constraint-tracking. Under appropriate assumptions that the objective and constraint functions are convex, their gradients are uniformly bounded, and the path length of the optimal solution sequence grows sublinearly, we analyze theoretical properties of the proposed algorithm and prove that both the dynamic regret and the constraint violation are sublinear with time horizon T. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a time-varying economic dispatch problem in power systems using both synthetic data and Australian Energy Market data. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs effectively in terms of tracking performance, constraint satisfaction, and adaptation to time-varying disturbances, thereby providing a practical and theoretically well-supported solution for real-time distributed economic dispatch."}

Fewer such examples are available when the function to minimize is non-convex.

We argue that the continuized framework (Even et al., 2021), mixing continuous and discrete components, can tighten the gap between known continuous and discrete results. This framework relies on computations akin to standard Lyapunov analyses, from which are deduced convergence bounds for an algorithm that can be written as a Nesterov momentum algorithm with stochastic parameters. In this work, we extend the range of applicability of the continuized framework, e.g. by allowing it to handle non-smooth Lyapunov functions. We then strengthen its trajectory-wise guarantees for linear convergence rate, deriving finite time bounds with high probability and asymptotic almost sure bounds. We apply this framework to the non-convex class of strongly quasar convex functions.

Next to an electric autonomous vehicle fleet, in the literature, a weighted-sum objective function, which combines the classic routing cost-oriented objective with a user-oriented objective function, has usually been considered. The user-oriented objective function minimizes the total excess user ride time. In this work, we treat them as two separate objective functions, which are optimized concurrently. In order to address the resulting bi-objective E-ADARP, we develop a novel exact framework (called fragment-based checker), whose core part is a smart ``select-and-check\" algorithm that iteratively constructs feasible solutions using fragments. Several enhancements are proposed to enforce the computational efficiency of the proposed method. In the computational experiments, we evaluate several variants of our checker algorithm by leveraging a previously developed branch-and-price algorithm. We benchmark the checker-based framework against state-of-the-art criterion space frameworks as well as a generalized branch-and-price algorithm. Numerical results on both bi-objective DARP and E-ADARP instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. With our proposed approaches, 21 out of 38 instances are solved optimally, where small-to-medium-sized instances are solved within seconds. On larger-scale instances, especially those requiring high battery end levels are computationally challenging to solve, our approaches provide high-quality approximations of the Pareto frontiers. Efficient solutions with varying energy restrictions are compared and we obtain valuable managerial insights for different kinds of service providers."}

Both methods feature an upwind flux and can handle Manning's and Chezy's friction law. By numerical experiment we demonstrate the discontinuous Galerkin method to be fully second-order accurate for the Barenblatt analytical solution on an inclined plane.

We introduce a unified framework for formalizing classes of rules according to the information about the input that they rely on. Within this framework, we show lower bounds for \\emph{ranking-based} classes of rules that base their decisions on orderings of the improving pivot steps induced by the underlying data. Our first result is a superpolynomial lower bound for strategy improvement, obtained via a family of sink parity games, which applies to memory-based generalizations of Bland's rule that only access the input by comparing the ranks of improving edges in some global order. Our second result is a subexponential lower bound for policy iteration, obtained via a family of Markov decision processes, which applies to memoryless rules that only access the input by comparing improving actions according to their ranks in a global order, their reduced costs, and the associated improvements in objective value. Both results carry over to the simplex method for linear programming."}

Specifically, VQE has achieved great success for ground state calculations of a Hamiltonian. However, excited state calculations arising in quantum chemistry and condensed matter often requires solving more challenging problems than the ground state as these states are generally further away from a mean-field description, and involve less straightforward optimization to avoid the variational collapse to the ground state. Maintaining orthogonality between low-lying eigenstates is a key algorithmic hurdle. In this work, we analyze three VQE models that embed orthogonality constraints through specially designed cost functions, avoiding the need for external enforcement of orthogonality between states. Notably, these formulations possess the desirable property that any local minimum is also a global minimum, helping address optimization difficulties. We conduct rigorous landscape analyses of the models' stationary points and local minimizers, theoretically guaranteeing their favorable properties and providing analytical tools applicable to broader VQE methods. A comprehensive comparison between the three models is also provided, considering their quantum resource requirements and classical optimization complexity."}

These bounds extend previous work on error bounds in the total variation distance, and are the first step towards a generalization to continuous-time Markov processes with continuous state spaces. A Wasserstein matrix norm is used to bound the error caused by the lower-dimensional approximation of the dynamics. In order to control the propagation of the accumulated error, we rely on the concept of coarse Ricci curvature of a Markov chain. The practical applicability of the presented bounds depends strongly on the curvature of the chain. Examples for CTMCs taken from the literature (where we added a metric on the state space) show that a negative curvature results in exponentially exploding bounds. On the other hand, certain CTMCs which we call translation-invariant always have non-negative curvature. When measuring the error in the total variation distance (a special case of the Wasserstein distance with the discrete metric), the curvature is also always non-negative. If it is strictly positive, the bounds presented in this paper are an improvement over previous work."}

This article presents a systematic PRISMA-based review of OP research published between 2017 and 2025, with a focus on models and methods that have shaped subsequent developments in the field. We introduce a component-based taxonomy that decomposes OP variants into time-, path-, node-, structure-, and information-based extensions. This framework unifies classical and emerging variants -- including stochastic, time-dependent, Dubins, Set, and multi-period OPs -- within a single structural perspective. We further categorize solution approaches into exact algorithms, heuristics and metaheuristics, and learning-based methods, with particular emphasis on matheuristics and recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement learning and neural networks, which enhance scalability in large-scale and information-rich settings. Building on this unified view, we discuss how different components affect computational complexity and polyhedral properties and identify open challenges related to robustness, sustainability, and AI integration. The survey thus provides both a consolidated reference for existing OP research and a structured agenda for future theoretical and applied work."}

The latter immediately implies the unconditional stability of the scheme. Based on the comparison principle we prove the convergence of the scheme to the viscosity solution of obstacle mean curvature flow. Moreover, using the minimizing movements interpretation, we show convergence of a spatially discrete model. Finally, we present numerical experiments for a physical model that inspired this work."}

For these, transition uncertainty is modelled by a convex set of transition matrices. In the precise case, hitting probabilities are the minimal nonnegative solution of a linear system and admit a closed-form expression. We study the notion of reachability in the imprecise setting. The literature review highlights few different definitions of lower reachability; thus we explore the relations among them, presenting examples to clarify their logical implications. Using this revised definition of reachability for imprecise Markov chain, we partition the state space into classes of states whose hitting probabilities are trivially zero or one and those which require further computation. For these nontrivial states, we show that lower and upper hitting probabilities are the unique solutions of two nonlinear fixed-point equations. For the practical computation of lower and upper hitting probabilities, we propose iterative algorithms that alternate between solving a linear system and choosing an extreme point from the set of transition matrices. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in practice, these algorithms converge in substantially fewer iterations than the theoretically established worst-case bound."}

Self-similar Markov trees (ssMt) are random decorated trees that encode the genealogy of a system of particles carrying positive labels, and where particles undergo splitting and growth depending on their labels in a self-similar fashion. Introduced and developed in the recent monograph (Bertoin-Curien-Riera, 2024), they provide a broad generalization of Brownian and stable continuum random trees and arise naturally in various models of random geometry such as the Brownian sphere/disk. The law of a ssMt is characterized by its quadruplet $(\\mathrm{a}, σ^2, \\boldsymbolΛ; α)$, which specifies the features of the underlying growth-fragmentation mechanism, together with the initial decoration $x>0$. In this work, we focus on special cases of ssMt in which the trees started from different initial values $x>0$ can be coupled into a continuous, increasing family of nested subtrees. In the case of the Brownian and stable continuum random trees, this yields surprisingly simple novel dynamics corresponding to the scaling limit of the leaf-growth algorithms of Luczak-Winkler and Caraceni-Stauffer."}

However, replacing the underlying random distribution (e.g., demand distribution) with its mean (e.g., the time-varying average arrival rate) introduces bias in performance estimation and can lead to suboptimal decisions. In this paper, we investigate how to identify an alternative point statistic, which is not necessarily the mean, such that substituting this statistic into the two-stage optimization problem yields the optimal decision. We refer to this statistic as the decision-corrected point estimate (time-varying arrival rate). For a general service network with customer abandonment costs, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a corrected point estimate and propose an algorithm for its computation. Under a decomposable network structure, we further show that the resulting decision-corrected point estimate is closely related to the classical newsvendor solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decision-focused correction method compared to the traditional fluid approximation."}
